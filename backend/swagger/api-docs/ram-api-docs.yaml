      summary: Price Estimates
      description: |
        The Price Estimates endpoint returns an estimated price range
        for each product offered at a given location. The price estimate is
        provided as a formatted string with the full price range and the localized
        currency symbol.<br><br>The response also includes low and high estimates,
        and the [ISO 4217](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) currency code for
        situations requiring currency conversion. When surge is active for a particular
        product, its surge_multiplier will be greater than 1, but the price estimate
        already factors in this multiplier.
