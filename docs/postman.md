# Postman Collection

There is a Postman Collection in the project that helps drive the system apis for various scenarios. These 
are useful to simulate who's logged in, what is returned etc. The collection can be used by developers to help
verify the system is working whilst developing and QA to determine what the system is doing including for fields
that might not be visible in the user interface.

There are two types of files of interest:

* Environment - these define the different configuration specific for each environment, eg hostname
* Collection - these define the different api endpoints grouped into logical folders

Here is a screenshot of Postman:
